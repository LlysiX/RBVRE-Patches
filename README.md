# RBVREnhanced Rawfile Patches

Mix and match to your liking, these patches include many ways to change/improve the experience of RBVR.

You MUST have [RBVREnhanced](https://github.com/RBEnhanced/RBVREnhanced) installed for these to work.

## Installation

You can add these to RBVR in 2 different ways:

1. Download [RBVREnhanced Launcher](https://github.com/LlysiX/RBVRE-Launcher), drag the patch folders onto the window, select your RBVR Folder, and Run RBVR

2. Place the rawfiles folders of the patches you want into the root of your RBVR install. Then simply Run rbvr.exe

## Important Notes

You don't need to use the track speed patches if you are using RBVREnhanced Launcher, as it now has a track speed multiplier option. The information about track speeds below still applies to that option.

The RB1-4 Base Multiplier Track Speeds are designed to be used in conjunction with the non-VR RB4 Track patch, if used with the default track or the VR mode RB4 track, it will be very fast.

The inverse is true for the RBVR base multiplier speeds.

Custom Highways have been added to RBVREnhanced Launcher. It currently does not work with the default highway.

No track sides doesn't work with the default highway.

The non-VR RB4 Track has many issues currently, specifically:
* No pausing (currntly half works, you have to unplug your guitar)
* No SFX and extremely loud song audio
* No HUD
* No beatlines or sustain tails
* Missing Textures/Animations
* ~~Not fully visible~~ (Fixed July 15, 2022)
